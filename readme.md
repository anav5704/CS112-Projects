## Getting Started
First fork and clone the repo. Make sure you have the G++ compiler installed. Then, choose the program you want to run and compile it:
```
g++ -o <output_file_name> <name_of_files(s)_you_want_to_run>
```
Once successfully compiled, you can execute the output file using:
```
./<output_file_name> 
```
